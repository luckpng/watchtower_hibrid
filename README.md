This project is all about how to use Watchtower to deploy and monitor containers.

1 - First of all, in this case, we will show only the deploy stage where Watchtower's container will be running and searching for images.

2 - We will use Azure Pipelines to deploy our application and deploy to our on premise server.

3 - We need a container registry subscription, in my case, i use Azure Container Registry (ACR).

4 - AZURE PIPELINES RULES JENKINS AND THATS ALL!!
